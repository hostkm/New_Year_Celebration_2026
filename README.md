# 🎆 New Year Celebration 2026 🎆

🎉 **Happy New Year 2026!** 🎉  
From me — a **computer & programming enthusiast** —  
to everyone who loves **logic, code, terminals, and creativity**.

May **2026** bring you:
- clean code 🧹  
- fewer bugs 🐞  
- faster builds ⚡  
- stable deployments 🚀  
- and lots of successful commits 💻✨  

This project is my way of celebrating the New Year **through code**.

## 🧠 About the Project

**New_Year_Celebration_2026** is a **pure Python terminal application** that simulates a New Year countdown and celebration:

- Displays a **big ASCII year `2025 → 2026`**
- Shows a **live simulated clock** from `23:57:00` to `00:03:00`
- Animates the **digit transition**:
  - `5` moves away
  - `6` smoothly appears
- Triggers celebration **exactly at midnight**
- Displays **festive messages, emojis, stars, and confetti**
- Plays **sound effects on Windows**
- Works without using real system time

All animations and timing are **relative to program start**, making it perfect for demos, recordings, or showcases.

## ⏱️ Timeline Simulation

The program simulates the following timeline:

| Time | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| 23:57:00 – 23:58:59 | Static **2025** displayed |
| 23:59:00 – 23:59:59 | Animated transition `5 → 6` |
| 00:00:00 | 🎉 **Happy New Year 2026** message appears |
| 00:00:00 – 00:03:00 | Celebration mode (stars, emojis, sound) |
| 00:03:00 | Program exits cleanly |
